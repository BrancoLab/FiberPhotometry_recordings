# FiberPhotometry_recordings
Code to preprocess and analyse fiberphotometry recordings in the Branco Lab. 


# Installation
## User
If you just need to 'use' the fiberphotometry code without editing anything, you can 
just install it as a python package. 

If you don't have one already, start by creating a python environment with python version 3.7.

Then install the `fiberphotometry` package with
```
    pip install git+https://github.com/BrancoLab/Behaviour.git
```

The package requires additional libraries that can be installed from github with:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/BrancoLab/Behaviour.git
pip install git+https://github.com/FedeClaudi/fcutils.git
pip install git+https://github.com/BrancoLab/tdmstovideo_converter.git
```

## Developer
To edit and contribute to the code, clone this repository to your computer. 
To use the cloned code you'll need a python environment that satisfies the same requirements 
outlined above, but without `fiberphotometry` installed as a package.
